libnotify bindings to erlang

Right now the only thing it can do is send a notify msg, which is fine for about 80% of all stuff I want to do, but then it is not a binding.

To compile:
autoconf && ./configure && make


TODO:
- Remove dependency for automake 2.64. Need different AC macros that can detect erlang installs

- NIFify. Instead of a driver perhaps NIF? The problem is what to do with callbacks.

- Implement a backend that behaves like notify bindings. i.e very explicit calls to the osd backend. Maybe use d-bus?
